        When I was 7, I saw a Christmas Carol onstage, my dad was
        playing Fred, Scroogeâ€™s nephew, seeing him perform in this
        production introduced me to a lifelong love of the theatre.
        When I was 9, I was in my first play, I was train number 3 in
        a school production of Alice in Wonderland. For the longest
        time, the theatre was a place for me to create, explore,
        and play, leading me to pursue a degree in theatre when I
        was in College. Though in the theatre I always imagined
        myself onstage, I quickly began to fall more and more in love
        with the offstage work: Set Design, Costume Design, Light
        Design, you name it, and I was trying to get involved in it.

        Design was a way for me to see the world in its best light,
        to be able to take a blank slate and create a world of my
        own that was beautiful, colorful, and hopeful. After
        graduating I was searching for a way to feed my creative
        soul, this led me to UX/UI Design. I decided to enroll in
        the Bloc UX Design program, to see if that love of design
        would translate from onstage to onscreen.

        Design is not just important to me, but the entire world.
        Design literally surrounds us every moment of every day.
        Knowing that I can contribute to that world and hopefully
        inspire someone else to follow their passions, no matter
        how unlikely, is a thought that motivates me to my core.
