                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Communication within the theatre is always chaos, with
                        so much going on and with so many teams working on one
                        project, a lot of information can get lost or
                        overlooked. Stagehand is a web application that utilizes
                        cloud storage to create more efficient and effective
                        communication within the theatre.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="second-title">Problem:</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        When you have multiple teams working on the same
                        project, sometimes quality gets sacrificed for
                        efficiency, leaving creative vision and promise
                        unfulfilled. While there can only be so many meetings
                        with cast, crew, and design teams, there needs to be a
                        way to store share and consolidate information without
                        bogging everyone down. That's where Stagehand comes in.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="second-title">Solution:</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Create a cloud storage web application that would
                        streamline the communication between teams within the
                        theatre. Stagehand enhances the communication experience
                        of the production team. Information in the theatre is
                        always changing and new ideas pop up frequently, it's
                        hard to stay current on what the plan is. With Stagehand
                        the user can upload, share, and edit their ideas, and
                        keep up to the second record of what their tasks are.
                        Along with that, they also recieve real-time updates
                        from their stage managers and directors so that they can
                        work with the utmost efficiency. This means you can get
                        your work in on-time and on budget.

                        While these are three popular applications (Evernote,
                        Google Drive, and Trello) , it seems that none have a
                        truly free option, but because of this you aren’t
                        cluttered and bombarded with ads. You could create an
                        application with a flat fee instead of monthly. I also
                        believe that creating something simple, without an
                        overwhelming amount of tools/add-ons would help make the
                        product more focused. Overall, I would say the
                        application with the most promise is google drive but
                        this could be improved upon by implementing the ideas

                        When creating the user survey, it was paramount to pay

                        dozen respondents. The results were varied but brought
                        some interesting things to my attention. Users want to:

                With these results, I knew how to start building my application.
                It was clear to me that users wanted to have one place to go to
                that would store all of their information. They were tired of
                checking multiple accounts or losing loose paper. Putting
                everything in an online space would help them become more
                prepared and more efficient in their endeavors.

                            made wireframing stagehand feel like a breeze.
                            Knowing where I wanted items to go, it easy easier
                            to create the basis of stagehand from there.

                    Everything has been user-tested and thought out. The final
                    clickable prototype took away the bells and whistles and
                    stripped it down and wasn’t trying so hard to impress the
                    users. It gave the users the necessary actions and worked
                    with the users, instead of the users working for it. When it
                    came to user testing, I sent the product to three people. I
                    conducted two of the tests in person, and one remote. The
                    users were all involved with the theatre at different
                    levels, one was a student getting their MFA in theatre
                    studies, one was an intern at a theatre in D.C, and the
                    other was a theatre professor. Overall, the feedback from
                    the user test was very positive. There were some notes on
                    making images consistent and questions about why every link
                    wasn’t active, but beyond that were more specific and
                    insightful notes. The note that was shared amongst all
                    participants was to add more examples of items onto each
                    page. (i.e more groups, projects, or uploads, on their
                    respective pages). Two users noted that the Logo was the
                    right size, while the third said it should be smaller. As
                    well as, making sure all hover screens are consistent.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    When embarking on this project, I thought a web application
                    like this would surely exist, I was surprised to find that
                    it didn’t. After working on Stagehand for some time, I
                    realized that one of the reasons it doesn’t is due to the
                    idea that the theatre is a very hands-on group. Putting the
                    items into the cloud make give some people pause. Yet, as
                    society is moving towards a more and more paperless future,
                    surely a place as progressive as the theatre should as well.
                    What worked for stagehand was a simple clean design, that
                    has color. Initially, as evidenced in the first version of
                    the clickable prototype, I was thinking of making it more
                    demure, dramatic, and adding too many options. When I
                    stripped it down to the essentials and less about how to
                    make it fell theatrical, that’s when my vision truly came to
                    life. If given more time, I would have hand sketched more of
                    the screens before making the prototype. I feel like ones of
                    the walls I hit was trying to think of it on the screens
                    online, I got too absorbed into the project. I believe that
                    I would also talk to some professional theatres and see what
                    they would hope for out of a website like this and what
                    would have to happen for them to be interested.
